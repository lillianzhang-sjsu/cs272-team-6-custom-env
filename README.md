# Custom Environment for CS 272 Final Project
Authors: Niyati Aggarwal, Rajshri Ganesh Iyer, and Lillian Zhang

## Overview
Our custom environment is based on the highway environment. We added a car accident halfway down the road and modified the reward function to encourage safer driving. You can experience the environment in manual control mode by running ```python run_custom_env.py```.

## Differences from HighwayEnv
